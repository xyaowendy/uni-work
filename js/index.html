            <h2>Design Exploration</h2>
            <p>Our major project of DECO7180 is to implement a web-based application that presents
                <em>State Library of Queensland</em> data hosted on the <em>data.qld.gov.au</em>
                portal in an engaging and interactive manner. (Beetson, 2019)</p>
            <p>The design exploration is to explore data and find interesting ways to present the QSL data.
            I was required to design a poster and give a pitch to show my idea.</p>
            <p>
                Because of my late enrolment, it was a bit challenging to generate ideas at first.
                It was so kind of Michael to talk with and inspire me.
                The dataset I chose was Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages word lists. I suppose it
                would be great for language lovers to learn a new language in an interactive way. Besides,
                the Aboriginal language is also a way to learn their culture.
                According to the content of the dataset, the application would show some basic and simple vocabulary
                and sentences like how to say <em>Good day</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The user would use the application as a visitor first came to this place. There would be engaging
                conversations between the local and the user. The user, as a visitor, could learn the Aboriginal
                language in an interactive way.

            <h3>Presentation Assessment</h3>
            <p>In part A, it is required to make a design proposal.</p>
            <p>
                After discussion with my teammate <em>Chao Lin</em>,
                <em>Huiyu Zeng</em>, <em>Xuefeng Liu</em> and <em>Jiasheng Li</em>, we decided to implement a website
                about the Australian convict history called <em>Tale of Convicts</em>.
                The dataset going to be used was
                <em>British convict transportation registers</em>, which includes attributes like
                name of the convict, date of departure, destination and vessel.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main feature of our website is to take on a journey from Britain to
                Australia as a convict. Besides, the user can browse some interesting data by different
                years, states and vessels. Considering we are taking <em>Data Mining</em> this semester,
                we also want to implement an advanced feature, predicting if the user is descendent of
                the British convict.
            </p>
            <p>
                To present our proposal, we complete a concept document and make a pitch at class.
                As I didn't speak in the pitch part, my main job is to complete some part of the
                concept document like persona, site map and wireframe.

            <h3>Demo Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                Part B required us to present a demo like an MVP, showing what we want to and what we can implement
                at the end of the semester.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a coder, I was required to implement the prototype the designer provided. We built the framework of
                the website and divided the workload into four parts as there were 4 coders in our team. I was in charge
                of the <em>Sort by Year</em> part.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along with the CSS part shown in the images,
                I used a JS and CSS library <em>Odometer</em> to show the scroll effect of the year selector. I wrote
                some JS script to make the year number scrolled by clicking the up and down arrow, and PHP to transfer
                the year information between two pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this part, the year could be selected as any year like 0000 or 2020, and the color scheme hadn't
                been considered. The website still looked low-fidelity, but it showed the idea of our final product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compare to the site map in Part A, we cut down the <em>Sign up/in</em> feature as we saw little usage
                on our website.

            <h2>Major Project : Part C</h2>
            <h3>Final Product</h3>
            <p>
                Our final product is hosted on the uq zone
                <a class="link" href="https://deco7180-c01t08.uqcloud.net/" target="_blank">
                    https://deco7180-c01t08.uqcloud.net
                </a>. In our final version of the website, we have changed a lot from the one in MVP.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most obvious one is the color scheme thanks to my kindest teammate <em>Huiyu</em>, which makes
                our website more fit to the historical theme.
                Besides, we changed the CSS part and the layout of the content a lot.
                I chose some of fonts we use and added some interactive animation effect to some clicking part.
                Furthermore, I made the article section a paper stack effect, so it looks like a pile of paper
                and the paper shown is according to the year or state the user selects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I modified the year selector as well. I got some feedback said that the user may be confused about
                the year range and easily chose a year in which no data can be presented.
                At present, the user can only select years from 1787 to 1867
                which is the exact convict era and the year range in the dataset. The up or down arrow will
                disappear at 1787 and 1867 to indicate the user it is the start or the end of the era.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last but not least, I wrote three short stories about the convict according to the real history.
                The name, crime, sentence year and vessel the convict was on are all true with some plot I made up.
                I think it is really interesting for users to know a person at that time would be sent to Australia
                just because of <em>stealing oranges</em>. It just gives a peek of that time but from this part,
                people who are interested can find more about this part of history.

            <h3>Trade Show and Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The trade show is a great chance to present our final product to the public
                and potential buyers. It was a big success and we got a lot of stickers!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am quite satisfied with the final product we produced. It realises most of
                our ideas at proposal and it is really great to see them came true step by step.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, there are some parts we can improve in our future study and work. We didn't
                allocate the time very wisely, which made us in a hurry at the last few days before
                due. The plot section of our website is not as attractive as I imagined because of the
                lack of time and technology. We could communicate better and thus did a greater job.
                It is our first time to do a coding work in a team this semester,
                I believe we can do better and implement something really fancy next time.

            <p>
                It is great to meet so many kind tutors and peers in my contact class, which makes me from a total
                beginner of studio class to a more experienced (in some part) studio participant. We discussed a lot,
                exchanging ideas, and finally all sharpen our mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                The workshop class taught me a lot of technical skills thanks to <em>Michael</em>. I learned PHP, API and
                JavaScript knowledge which are all useful to my future study and work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The journal part is a good way to keep a record of our ideas. We are more forgettable than we think.
                When I looked back on all the journeys I wrote this semester, I found the evolution of my idea.

                Because of the late enrolment to this course, I hadn't wrote my journal
                until week3. Actually, I am not quite sure about the requirement of journal in

                At first, I chose this course just because it was a compulsory course for
                the master of IT. I am a coder with little sense of designing and like
                back-end coding much more than front-end. To be honest, I didn't expect too
                much when I chose to late enroll to the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                The expectations changed as soon as I attended a workshop class before enrolment.
                I found that I could learn something interesting from the course more than I expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then after all the meaningful events at contact and useful technical skills at workshop,
                I found myself quite enjoy this course already. From this course, I understand the
                meaning of teamwork, and how important for both designers and coders to make
                a product <em>user-centered</em>. I found myself more interested in front-end
                than before.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am really glad I chose this course and complete it quite well :)

            <h2>Learning across the Course</h2>
            <p>
                The contact session is a good way to communicate. Activities like
                <em>World Cafe</em> helped me to exchange opinions with others. The pitch assessment
                at class gave us a chance to learn from others' ideas and get feedback
                of ours.
            </p>
            <p>
                The workshop session taught me knowledge about PS, PHP, JavaScript and API.
                I have gained some PHP skills from the course <em>Web Information System</em> last
                semester, but I like it better with the way taught in this course.
            </p>
            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                In my opinion, the assessment detail of each part could be more clear to see. For example,
                I can not find the detail requirement of week 1 journal. The course is great
                and all the teaching staffs are kind and willing to help. Thank you so much!
            </p>
            <p>
                For myself, I should learn to communicate with my teammates better in the future.
                Also, I should allocate my time more wisely for this kind of semester-long project.

            <p>
                We also helped CSIRO to develop a web application based on Google Earth Engine
                this semester. Everyone can access the app from

            <p>SugarByte, a satellite-based crop monitoring platform,
                aims to help farmers in northern Australia know better
                about their paddock and minimize the usage of fertilizer.
                As runoff of unused fertilizer from sugarcane farms is an important
                factor of the Great Barrier bleaching, SugarByte can also help to prevent this.
